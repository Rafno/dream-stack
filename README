## **Good Combos**  
Here are some "good combos" of tools to consider when starting a new project:

- **Airflow + dbt + PostgreSQL**  
  Ideal for traditional ETL workflows. Airflow handles orchestration, dbt manages data transformations, and PostgreSQL stores transactional data.

- **Prefect + SQLMesh + Snowflake**  
  Great for modern data pipelines with a focus on orchestration (Prefect), transformation (SQLMesh), and scalable analytics (Snowflake).

- **Apache Kafka + Spark + Databricks**  
  Perfect for real-time streaming data and large-scale data processing. Kafka is used for real-time messaging, Spark for distributed processing, and Databricks for managing the entire pipeline.

- **Airbyte + Snowflake + Tableau**  
  A solid choice for integrating data from various sources with Airbyte, storing it in Snowflake, and visualizing it using Tableau.

- **MLflow + PyTorch + PostgreSQL**  
  A combination focused on machine learning workflows. MLflow helps with experiment tracking and model management, PyTorch for deep learning, and PostgreSQL for storing metadata and results.

- **Fivetran + BigQuery + Looker**  
  A strong choice for businesses looking for a fully managed pipeline. Fivetran handles integrations, BigQuery stores your data in the cloud, and Looker provides analytics and reporting.

- **Trino + Snowflake + Tableau**  
  A great combo for querying and analyzing large datasets across multiple data sources. Trino allows fast SQL querying on various data storage systems, Snowflake acts as a scalable data warehouse, and Tableau provides insightful visualizations.
